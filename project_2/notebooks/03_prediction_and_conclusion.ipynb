    "\n",
    "All the 4 models listed above are regression models. The basic interpretation is that with every increase in an x, the response variable y will increase by coefficient beta times. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ridge and Lasso regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge and Lasso regressions are regressions that control for high variance in models, meaning that they control the amount of complexity the models have. They both do this by adding a penalty term to the basic linear regression equation. The difference between the two is how strongly this penalty term is weighted. Ridge regression takes the square of the penalty term, while Lasso simply takes the absolute value of the penalty term.\n",
    "\n",
    "For practical purposes, you can think of Ridge and Lasso regressions as 'reducing the strength' of variable coefficients. For example, if one variable x has coefficient 10,000, both regressions might reduce the strength to about 1,000. The difference between Ridge and Lasso is **how much** and **how quickly** the coefficient size is reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression reduces linear regression coefficients gradually, with a steep decrease at the start and a tapered decrease later on. However, the coefficients will never disappear. They may be small, but **all the features used in Ridge regression will remain in the model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Lasso regression, the decrease in coefficient size is very quick, almost linearly straight down. Coefficients can be set to 0, meaning that **some features will not be used in the model any longer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ElasticNet regression\n",
    "\n",
    "ElasticNet is simply a mix of both Lasso and Ridge regressions, weighted with a lambda variable. If lambda=1, ElasticNet is using purely Lasso regression. If lambda=0, it's using purely Ridge regression. if lambda is anywhere between 0 and 1, it's using a mix of both regressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choosing the production model\n",
    "\n",
    "For my models above, the scores are around the same. This is not surprising as the best features were already selected by Sequential Feature Selector. ElasticNet did worse than either Lasso or Ridge on a default setting of 0.5 and only scored around the same as Ridge and Lasso regression. The optimal mix of Lasso and Ridge regressions, at 0.456, was still not as good as purely Lasso.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will pick the Lasso regression model because it gives the same score as Linear Regression. While I could have picked Linear Regression, the fact is that linear regression gives the 'baseline' score. Lasso Regression is still slightly better.\n",

    "## Section 7: Interpreting the Lasso Regression Model and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Most Important positive factors\n",
    "\n",
    "**gr_liv_area, overall_qual, and year_built** seem to be the three strongest factors that affect housing prices. Simply increasing your above ground living area square feet by 1 increases the housing price by a wooping 30,172! Comparatively, overall_qual and year_built are about a third as strong, with an increase in overall quality by 1 signalling an increase by 12,532. Finally, every new year that arrives means that houses selling in that year are about 10,130 more expensive than the previous year!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Negative factors\n",
    "\n",
    "**ms_subclass** is the first feature we find,and it's a numerical nominal class. It starts with 020 and ends with 190 with increments of 5 (e.g. 040 -> 045) or 10 (e.g. 020 -> 030). This tells us that the higher the number, the less valuable the house is. Meaning that 2 FAMILY CONVERSION - ALL STYLES AND AGES is less valuable than 1-STORY 1946 & NEWER ALL STYLES. An increase by 10 in this variable decreases value by 60,280 (multiplied by 10 since each increment is a multiple of 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "**bedroom_abvgr**. 'abvgr' refers to a value in the discrete 'bedroom' category, refering to the number of bedrooms above ground. Apparently the more bedrooms you have above ground, the cheaper your house, by 3787. Perhaps because it is exposed to the noise of the streets, or because it's another signal for the fact that the house doesn't have bedrooms below ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "**mas_vnr_type_BrkFace**. 'BrkFace' refers to the Brick Face masonry veneer type. If you have this type of veneer, your house value drops by 4330. Perhaps this is because Brick Face is a cheaper type of veneer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**garage_type_Attchd**. Having a garage attached (Attchd) to your home means your house is cheaper by 2000. This sounds like it's a signal for how the house was built. In other words, only houses built a certain way will have a garage attached to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other factors\n",
    "\n",
    "**neighbourhood_...** the elipses refers to the different types of neighborhoods the house can be located in. While none of the neighborhoods reduce prices, there are neighborhoods that can increase prices by as much as 5x with a baseline of around 1700. For example, compare BrkSide and NridgeHt, with BrkSide increasing prices by 1713 compared to NridgeHt's 7387.\n",
    "\n",
    "**lot_area, overall_qual**, are all easily understood. As the size, quality, and condition of your house increases, prices increase too. The later your house was built, the more expensive it is. The quality of your house and the year it was built has the strongest effect amonth the 4, increasing house prices by more than 10,000. lot_area and overall_cond contribute about half as much as the former 2 variables!\n",
    "\n",
    "**mas_vnr_area, exter_qual, bsmt_qual, bsmt_exposure** continue the trend of easily interpretable variables. The more veneer, the higher the quality of the exterior, the higher the quality of the basement, and the more exposure there is to walkout or garden level walls, the higher the price of the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "**bsmtfin_sf_1, total_bsmt_sf**. The more you have something called type 1 finished area in your basement, the higher your price, while total basement area makes the house more expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the factors, like 'other factors' above, are easy to interpret. In the end, the bigger the house, with a better rating of quality and condition, fetches you the highest prices. Even if you have the negative factors attached to the home, they only reduce prices by a factor of 1/5 or so (i.e. prices reduce by -6000 for every 30,000 increase in price, given ms_subclass and gr_liv_area). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### For Companies\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given house, make sure that the quality and condition matches the one stated on paper. While it may be possible, though not advisable, to sell a BrkfacFace veneer at a more expensive price than expected, it's impossible to hide a house's quality and condition. If your company builds and sells property, you may want to build 1 story houses instead of 2 family conversions as it gives a better return of investment. However, watch out for market saturation: too many of the same type of house and the houses won't command as much money.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For Consumers\n",
    "\n",
    "Location, location, location matters. Assuming you are someone most concerned with price, try to go for a cheaper neighborhood. But if you wish to stay at, say, NridgeHt, it's not the end of the world. Buy a more run down home and upgrade it yourself! Look for bedrooms above ground, and try to get a house that has a garage attached to it. Get an older house, not one built recently; the older the house the better. Make sure you don't buy a house with a basement. Get a house with a Brick Face veneer and renovate the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "With a linear regression model built for this town, perhaps building another linear regression model on a similar dataset for another town would be useful. With the two linear models, we can compare the coefficients and find out whether the same features play the biggest part in housing prices."
